A Cookiecutter app to create python project related to the RAG and machine learning project.
This repository contains a sample Data Science application built with FastAPI, designed to streamline model training and prediction processes via RESTful APIs. The application leverages **Poetry** for dependency management, ensuring a robust and scalable development environment.

---

## Features

### FastAPI Endpoints:

-   `/upload-docs`: API endpoint to upload documents for creating embeddings.
-   `/ask`: API endpoint for querying the system and receiving context-aware answers.

### Poetry for Dependency Management:

-   Simplifies package installation and management.
-   Ensures compatibility and reproducibility of the project environment.

### Scalable Architecture:

-   Modular design with clear separation of concerns.
-   Easy integration of new features or pipelines.

---

## Prerequisites

-   Python >= 3.12
-   Poetry installed (`pip install poetry`)
